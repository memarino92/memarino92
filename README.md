Hi, I'm Michael, a software engineer based in Richmond, Virginia. Outside of building highly-available, durable web applications for my day job, I also enjoy hiking, lifting heavy things, and sharing my love of solving problems with programming.You can find my personal site/blog at [michaelmarino.dev](https://www.michaelmarino.dev)

I build full-stack web applications using a variety of technologies, mostly centered around the .NET and Typescript ecosystems with an emphasis on embracing modern web APIs. I'm a contributor to open source projects such as [Astro](https://astro.build) and [RedwoodJs](https://redwoodjs.com/), and love sharing what I've learned by speaking at local meetups and conferences such as RVA.js and RVASDUG.
