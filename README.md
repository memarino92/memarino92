## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael. You can find my personal site/blog at [michaelmarino.dev](https://www.michaelmarino.dev)

Hard-working and driven, I came to tech from the restaurant industry. My experience working for a multinational MSP, like my time working in kitchens, has taught me the power of a well organized and well trained team. I bring professional experience in working with Angular, ASP.NET, IdentityServer, Docker, SQL Server, Azure, Git, and I'm a contributor to open source projects like [Astro](https://astro.build) and [RedwoodJs](https://redwoodjs.com/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m in the early stages of building [SettlUp.app](https://settlup.app), an ever-improving tool for splitting expenses.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on practicing Test Driven Development
