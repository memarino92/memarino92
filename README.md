## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael. Check out my personal site/blog at [michaelmarino.dev](https://www.michaelmarino.dev)

Hard-working and driven, I came to tech from the restaurant industry. My experience working for a multinational MSP, like my time working in kitchens, has taught me the power of a well organized and well trained team. I bring professional experience in working with Angular, ASP.NET, IdentityServer, Docker, SQL Server, Azure, Git, and am a contributor to projects like RedwoodJs and A Wedge of Django (formerly Django Crash Course).
